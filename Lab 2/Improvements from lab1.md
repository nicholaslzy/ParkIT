## Lab 2: Improvements Based on Feedback

- Reduced the number of insignificant use cases: We focused on the most essential use cases to streamline the flow.

- Ensured all use cases had 4+ lines in the flow of events: This added more detail and clarity to the use cases, improving their depth and verifiability.

- Made sure all statements in the use case description are verifiable: We updated and validated descriptions to ensure they are testable and can be verified during development.

- Thank you for the feedback
