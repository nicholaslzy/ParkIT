## Overview

ParkIT is an intuitive web app that my group and I designed and built for our module, SC2006 Software Engineering.
ParkIT utilises government APIs to provide real-time information about Carpark pricing and availability,  
allowing Singapore drivers to make more informed parking-related decisions.
