# Changes made based on feedback/ Extra features
- We have added 3 new features to our car parking app - settings page, AI chatbot for support and Distress API. Hence we added the functional requirements for those and updated our use cases based on the previous feedback 
- For use case descriptions - we ensured to be consistent with "driver" and "user" terms , added the include use cases to the flow of event and exclude use cases to the alternate flow, ensured we dont repeat the pre condition and flow of events step 1
